            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>EduTech was born from a vision to empower students in their educational journey after 10th class. In 2024, a group of students from <a href="https://view.edu.in/">Vignan's Institute Of Engineering For Women</a> conducted a comprehensive survey in the STBL area of Kapujaggarajupeta, Visakhapatnam. The survey revealed a significant gap in awareness about educational pathways and a pressing need for mental health support among students transitioning from 10th class.</p>
            <p>Driven by these findings, we embarked on a mission to create a centralized platform that addresses these crucial needs. EduTech is the result of our commitment to making a positive impact in our community.</p>
